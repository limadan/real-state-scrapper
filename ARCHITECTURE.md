# Project Architecture & Database Design

This document outlines the system architecture and data model for the Intelligent Real Estate Finder project.

---

## 1. System Architecture

The application is designed with a decoupled architecture, separating the user-facing components (Frontend, API) from the background data processing services (Scrapers, Notifiers). This ensures scalability and maintainability.

# 1.2. Component Breakdown

## Frontend (Angular)
A single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface. Its responsibilities are:

- Displaying the found real estate properties in an interactive dashboard.
- Allowing the user to manage the `search_criteria` table (add, edit, delete search profiles).
- Allowing the user to manage the `email_list` table.
- It communicates exclusively with the Backend API.

## Backend API
A server-side application that acts as the bridge between the frontend and the database.

- Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for `search_criteria` and `email_list`.
- Provides an endpoint to read properties from the database for display on the dashboard.
- Handles authentication and authorization (if implemented in the future).
- Connects directly to the Turso Database to execute SQL queries.

## Background Worker (Scraper & Notifier)
A standalone service or a set of scripts that run independently from the user-facing application.

- **Scheduler:** Triggered every 5 minutes by a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism.
- **Scraper:** Fetches data from target real estate websites. It reads the active search criteria from the database to perform the searches.
- **Notifier:** When a new property that matches the criteria is found, this component is responsible for sending a notification email to all addresses in the `email_list`.

## Database (Turso DB)
A distributed SQLite database (using libSQL) that acts as the single source of truth for the application.  
It stores all persistent data.

---

# 2. Core Workflow (Scraping & Notification)

The background process follows a clear, scheduled cycle:

1. **Trigger:** The scheduler executes the worker script every 5 minutes.  
2. **Fetch Criteria:** The worker connects to Turso DB and reads all entries from the `search_criteria` and `email_list` tables.  
3. **Scrape Websites:** The worker visits the target real estate websites and performs searches based on the fetched criteria.  
4. **Process Properties:** For each property found on a website:  
   a. It extracts key details (price, location, etc.) and a unique identifier from the source (e.g., the listing ID).  
   b. It checks the `real_state_property` table in Turso DB to see if a record with the same source website and source ID already exists.  
5. **Match & Act:** If the property does not exist in the database and matches the user's criteria:  
   a. **Insert:** The worker inserts the new property's details into the `real_state_property` table.  
   b. **Notify:** The worker sends a notification email to every email address stored in the `email_list` table.  
6. **Sleep:** The worker finishes its execution and waits for the next trigger from the scheduler.

# 3. Database Relational Model

The database is designed to be simple and efficient for the project's core needs.

## 3.1. Entity-Relationship Diagram

**Note:** To ensure properties are unique, the columns `source_id` and `source_website` have been added to the `real_state_property` table. Together, they will act as a unique key.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    real_state_property {
        INTEGER id PK "Auto-incrementing primary key"
        VARCHAR source_id "Unique ID from the source website"
        VARCHAR source_website "Domain of the source website (e.g., zillow.com)"
        DECIMAL price "Property price"
        VARCHAR city
        VARCHAR neighbourhood
        INTEGER number_of_rooms
        INTEGER number_of_parking_spaces
        VARCHAR photo_url "URL of the main photo"
        VARCHAR access_link "URL to the original listing"
        DATETIME created_at "Timestamp of when the record was inserted"
    }

    search_criteria {
        INTEGER id PK "Auto-incrementing primary key"
        VARCHAR city
        VARCHAR neighbourhood
        DECIMAL min_price
        DECIMAL max_price
        INTEGER min_number_of_rooms
        INTEGER max_number_of_rooms
        INTEGER min_number_of_parking_spaces
        INTEGER max_number_of_parking_spaces
    }

    email_list {
        VARCHAR email PK "User's email address"
    }
```
