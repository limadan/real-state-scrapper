# Project Architecture & Database Design

This document outlines the system architecture and data model for the Intelligent Real Estate Finder project.

---

## 1. System Architecture

The application is designed with a decoupled architecture, separating the user-facing components (Frontend, API) from the background data processing services (Scrapers, Notifiers). This ensures scalability and maintainability.

            Scraper -- Scrapes data --> RWS[Real Estate Websites];
            Scraper -- Inserts new property --> DB;
        end
        subgraph Notifier Process
            WeeklySched[Weekly Scheduler] --> Notifier[Notifier Service];
            Notifier -- Reads new properties & email list --> DB;
            Notifier -- Sends weekly digest --> Mail[Email Service];
        end
    end
```

# 1.2. Component Breakdown

## Frontend (Angular)
A single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface.  
It communicates exclusively with the Backend API.

---

## Backend API (Python)
The central hub for user interactions.

- Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for `search_criteria` and `email_list`.
- Provides an endpoint to read properties from the database for display on the dashboard.
- Connects directly to the Turso Database.

## Scraper Service (Python)
A dedicated background service with a single responsibility: **finding and storing properties**.

- Triggered every 5 minutes by a scheduler (like a cron job).
- Reads the latest search criteria from the database.
- Scrapes target websites, checks for new properties that match the criteria, and inserts them into the `real_state_property` table.

## Notifier Service (Python)
An independen service responsible for sending notifications. Observes the database for newly inserted properties. When a new property is detected:
  - Reads the property details and the full `email_list` from the database.
  - Sends a notification to all registered email addresses.

## Database (Turso DB)
The central data store for the entire application.

# 2. Core Workflow (Scraping & Notification)

The background process follows a clear, scheduled cycle:

1. **Trigger:** The scheduler executes the worker script every 5 minutes.  
2. **Fetch Criteria:** The worker connects to Turso DB and reads all entries from the `search_criteria` and `email_list` tables.  
3. **Scrape Websites:** The worker visits the target real estate websites and performs searches based on the fetched criteria.  
4. **Process Properties:** For each property found on a website:  
   a. It extracts key details (price, location, etc.) and a unique identifier from the source (e.g., the listing ID).  
   b. It checks the `real_state_property` table in Turso DB to see if a record with the same source website and source ID already exists.  
5. **Match & Act:** If the property does not exist in the database and matches the user's criteria:  
   a. **Insert:** The worker inserts the new property's details into the `real_state_property` table.  
   b. **Notify:** The worker sends a notification email to every email address stored in the `email_list` table.  
6. **Sleep:** The worker finishes its execution and waits for the next trigger from the scheduler.

# 3. Database Relational Model

The database is designed to be simple and efficient for the project's core needs.

## 3.1. Entity-Relationship Diagram

**Note:** To ensure properties are unique, the columns `source_id` and `source_website` have been added to the `real_state_property` table. Together, they will act as a unique key.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    real_state_property {
        INTEGER id PK "Auto-incrementing primary key"
        TEXT source_id "Unique ID from the source website"
        TEXT source_website "Domain of the source website (e.g., zillow.com)"
        DECIMAL price "Property price"
        TEXT city
        TEXT neighbourhood
        INTEGER number_of_rooms
        INTEGER number_of_parking_spaces
        TEXT photo_url "URL of the main photo"
        TEXT access_link "URL to the original listing"
        TEXT state "Property state (e.g., available, sold)"
        DATETIME created_at "Timestamp of when the record was inserted"
    }

    search_criteria {
        INTEGER id PK "Auto-incrementing primary key"
        TEXT city
        TEXT neighbourhoods
        TEXT state
        DECIMAL min_price
        DECIMAL max_price
        INTEGER min_number_of_rooms
        INTEGER min_number_of_parking_spaces
    }

    email_list {
        TEXT email PK "User's email address"
    }
```
